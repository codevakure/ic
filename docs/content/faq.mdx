## Prompting & Chatting

**What is a prompt and how do I write an effective one?**  
In this application, a prompt is any message, question, or instruction you enter to communicate with the AI. An effective prompt is clear, specific, and provides enough context for the AI to understand your intent and deliver a relevant response.

**Tips for writing effective prompts:**
- Be clear and direct about what you want to know or accomplish.
- Include relevant details or context (such as the topic, audience, or format you need).
- Ask one question or request at a time for best results.

**Examples:**
- Less effective: "Tell me about loans."
- More effective: "Summarize the key differences between personal loans and business loans in a table format."

**Examples:**
- Less effective: “Explain mortgages.”
- Professional: “Provide a summary of fixed-rate versus adjustable-rate mortgages, including their advantages and disadvantages for first-time homebuyers.”

**Tips:**
- Specify the financial product or process.
- Indicate the audience (e.g., “for new customers” or “for compliance officers”).
- Request the format you need (e.g., summary, step-by-step, comparison table).

**What are some best practices for prompting Ranger?**  
**Be precise:** Include relevant financial terms, dates, or regulations.  
**Provide context:** State if the information is for internal staff, customers, or compliance.  
**Request structured output:** Ask for bullet points, tables, or numbered lists for clarity.  
**Maintain confidentiality:** Never include sensitive customer data in prompts.

**Example:**  
“List the key steps in the Know Your Customer (KYC) process for onboarding a new corporate client, in bullet points.”

**How do I ask follow-up questions or clarify responses?**  
Continue the conversation by referencing previous answers or requesting more detail.

**Examples:**  
- “Expand on the documentation required for KYC compliance.”
- “Can you provide an example of a suspicious transaction report?”
- “Clarify the difference between AML and CFT regulations.”

Ranger retains context, so you can build on previous queries without restating all details.


**How do I choose the best model for my needs?**  
Select a model based on the task:

- For regulatory or compliance queries, use a model optimized for accuracy and up-to-date knowledge.
- For customer service scripts, choose a model with strong conversational abilities.
- For data analysis or reporting, select a model capable of handling structured data and financial terminology.

If unsure, start with the default and evaluate the results for your specific use case.

## Troubleshooting & Support

**Why is the AI not responding as expected?**  
If the AI is not responding as expected, review your prompt for clarity and ensure all required information is provided. Technical issues may also affect responses.

**What should I do if I encounter an error?**  
If you encounter an error, first review your input for accuracy and ensure all required information is provided. Carefully read any error messages, as they often indicate the cause of the issue. Common solutions include correcting typos, providing additional context, or refreshing the page. If the problem persists, try restarting the application or checking your internet connection. For technical issues that cannot be resolved with these steps, contact your system administrator or support team for further assistance.
