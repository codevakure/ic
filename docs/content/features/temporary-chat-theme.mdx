## Temporary Chat & Theme

This section covers two important features available in the top-right corner of Ranger: Temporary Chat for private conversations and Theme customization for your visual preferences.

## Temporary Chat

### Overview

The Temporary Chat feature allows you to have private, one-time conversations without storing chat history. These chats begin with a blank slate and are ideal for discussions that you do not want saved in your history.

Key characteristics include:

- **Ranger will not be aware of previous conversations**
- **Memories will not be accessed**
- **Your custom instructions (if enabled) will still apply**

<Callout type="info">
  Temporary chats are perfect for sensitive discussions, testing scenarios, or when you want a completely fresh conversation context.
</Callout>

### Temporary Chat and History

Understanding how Temporary Chat handles your data and history:

**Not Saved in History:**
- Temporary Chats will not appear in your chat history panel
- No record is kept in your accessible chat threads

**Retention Policy:**
- For safety purposes, a copy may be retained for up to 30 days but will not be visible to you
- This retention is for system security and compliance purposes only

**No Memory Use:**
- Ranger will not remember anything discussed once the session ends
- Each temporary chat starts completely fresh without context from previous conversations

### When to Use Temporary Chat

**Ideal Use Cases:**
- **Sensitive Information:** Discussing confidential or personal matters
- **Testing Scenarios:** Experimenting with prompts or approaches without cluttering history
- **One-time Queries:** Quick questions that don't need to be saved

**Examples:**
- Drafting sensitive communications
- Exploring hypothetical scenarios
- Getting quick answers without saving context

<Callout type="tip">

</Callout>

### Important Considerations

**What's Still Active:**
- Your custom instructions and preferences remain in effect

- All tools and features work normally within the temporary session

**What's Different:**

**Privacy Benefits:**
- Conversations remain private and don't affect your profile
- Ideal for sensitive or personal discussions
- Provides peace of mind for confidential topics

<Callout type="info">
  Temporary Chat gives you full access to Ranger's capabilities while maintaining complete privacy for your conversation.
</Callout>

### Summary

The Temporary Chat feature provides a secure and private way to converse without saving history. The highlighted Temporary icon and message box ensure users are always aware when a Temporary Chat is active with Ranger.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Complete privacy** for sensitive conversations
- **Fresh context** for each temporary session
- **Visual confirmation** through highlighted indicators
