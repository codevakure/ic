## Choosing the Best Model

Ranger allows you to select the AI model that best fits your needs directly from the chat interface. Choosing the right model helps balance speed, cost, and capability depending on your task requirements.

### Overview

The model selection feature provides flexibility to match your AI assistant's capabilities with your specific needs:

- Model selection is available at the top-left of the chat screen, next to the left-side panel
- Once selected, the active model is visible, ensuring you know which model Ranger is using

<Callout type="tip">
  Selecting the appropriate model for your task can significantly improve efficiency, quality, and cost-effectiveness.
</Callout>

### Model Options

Ranger offers three model options, aligned with Claude models for performance and capability:

| Option | Claude Model Equivalent | Purpose | Best For |
|--------|-------------------------|---------|----------|
| **Instant** | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Fast and efficient responses for quick queries and simple tasks | Quick queries, basic customer support, formulaic content, routine tasks |
| **Thinking / Coding** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Advanced reasoning and programming capabilities with balanced performance | Complex reasoning, coding, structured data analysis, prompt-based logic |
| **Research** | Claude Opus 4.1 | Most capable model for deep analysis, complex reasoning, and research tasks | In-depth analysis, scientific/financial research, multi-agent frameworks, nuanced creative writing |

<Callout type="info">
  Each model represents a different balance point between speed, capability, and cost efficiency.

### Choosing a Model

#### Option 1: Start with a fast, cost-effective model (Instant / Claude Haiku 4.5)

Use for quick iteration and lower development costs.

**Steps:**
1. Select **Instant** from the model dropdown
2. Test your use case thoroughly
3. Evaluate if performance meets your requirements
4. Upgrade only if specific capability gaps arise

**Best for:**
- Initial prototyping and development
- Tight latency requirements
- Cost-sensitive implementations
- High-volume, straightforward tasks

<Callout type="tip">
  The Instant model is ideal when you need quick responses and are working with straightforward tasks that don't require deep analysis.
</Callout>

#### Option 2: Start with an advanced reasoning model (Thinking / Coding / Claude Sonnet 4.5)

Use for balanced performance with reasoning and programming capabilities.

**Steps:**
1. Select **Thinking / Coding** from the model dropdown
2. Optimize your prompts for the selected model
3. Evaluate if performance meets your requirements
4. Adjust efficiency as needed

**Best for:**
- Complex reasoning tasks
- Advanced coding
- Structured data processing
- Tasks requiring nuanced understanding

<Callout type="info">
  This model provides a good balance between capability and performance, making it suitable for most professional use cases.
</Callout>

#### Option 3: Start with a deep analysis model (Research / Claude Opus 4.1)

Use when intelligence and deep analysis are critical.

**Steps:**
1. Select **Research** from the model dropdown
2. Perform tasks requiring advanced reasoning or research
3. Optimize workflow as needed for efficiency

**Best for:**
- Complex scientific, financial, or creative analysis
- Multi-agent reasoning frameworks
- High-stakes decision-making
- Tasks where accuracy outweighs cost considerations

<Callout type="warning">
  The Research model provides the highest level of capability but may have slightly higher latency and cost compared to other models.
</Callout>

### Model Selection Strategy

**For New Projects:**
- Begin with the simplest model that might meet your needs
- Escalate to more powerful models only when necessary
- Test thoroughly at each level before upgrading

**For Established Workflows:**
- Match the model to the complexity of your regular tasks
- Consider using different models for different phases of work
- Balance performance requirements against budget constraints

<Callout type="tip">
  You can switch models mid-conversation if you find your current task requires more capability or if you want to optimize for speed.
