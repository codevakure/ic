## Forking Messages and Conversations

Forking allows you to create a new path in your chat, branching off from an existing conversation. This powerful feature helps you maintain organization while exploring multiple directions in your interactions with Ranger.

### Overview

The forking feature in Ranger provides a flexible way to branch your conversations:

- Explore side topics without derailing the main conversation
- Experiment with different approaches or "what if" scenarios
- Preserve important context while starting a new thread
- Share specific portions of a conversation without exposing the entire history
- Keep ideas organized across multiple threads

<Callout type="tip">
  Forking creates a new chat thread that includes your selected history, allowing you to maintain context while exploring new directions.
</Callout>

### Why Fork Conversations?

**Keep Things On Track**
- Dive into side topics while keeping the original chat clean
- Maintain focus in your primary conversation
- Return to the main thread without clutter from tangential discussions

**Play "What If"**
- Test different approaches in parallel conversations
- Compare results from alternative prompts or questions
- Experiment with different model selections on the same topic

**Save Important Context**
- Bring along as much or as little of the previous chat as needed
- Maintain critical background information in new threads
- Start a new conversation without losing valuable context

**Share Specific Parts**
- Fork only the relevant messages for sharing with colleagues
- Create focused conversation snippets for documentation
- Extract relevant portions for reports or presentations

**Keep Ideas Organized**
- Develop multiple ideas separately in their own threads
- Create distinct branches for different aspects of a project
- Maintain clean separation between related but independent topics

**Try Different Approaches**
- Experiment with new ways of asking questions without affecting the main conversation
- Test alternative phrasing without losing your original conversation flow
- Refine your prompting strategy in a separate thread

<Callout type="info">
  Each forked conversation maintains its own independent history after the fork point, allowing you to pursue different directions without affecting the original thread.

### Forking Options

#### Fork Scope

When forking a conversation, you can choose from several scope options that determine which messages will be included in your new thread:

**Visible Messages Only**
- Forks only the visible messages—direct path to the target message without any branches
- Ideal for creating a streamlined conversation history
- Best when you want to maintain a linear conversation flow

**Include Related Branches**
- Forks the visible messages plus related branches
- Includes the direct path to the target message including branches along that path
- Useful when context from related discussions is important

**Include All to/from Here (Default)**
- Forks all messages leading up to the target message, including neighbors and all message branches, whether visible or not
- Most comprehensive option that preserves full context
- Best when you need all available information from the conversation

<Callout type="tip">
  Choose "Visible Messages Only" for a clean, focused fork, or "Include All" when you need comprehensive context.
</Callout>

#### Additional Options

**Start Fork Here**
- Begin forking from the selected message to the latest message in the conversation, based on the chosen scope
- Useful for continuing from a specific point while excluding earlier messages
- Creates a new thread that starts from your chosen message

**Remember**
- Save your selected options for future forks to speed up the process
- Maintains your preferred forking settings for consistent use
- Streamlines your workflow when you frequently fork conversations in a similar way

### How to Fork a Conversation

1. **Locate the Fork Point:** Find the message where you want to create a branch
2. **Access Fork Options:** Click the three-dot menu or fork icon next to the message
3. **Select Fork Scope:** Choose from "Visible Messages Only," "Include Related Branches," or "Include All"
4. **Set Additional Options:** Enable or disable "Start Fork Here" and "Remember" settings as needed
5. **Create Fork:** Confirm your selection to create a new conversation thread

<Callout type="info">
  The forked conversation will appear as a new chat in your left navigation panel, with a name indicating it's a fork of the original conversation.
</Callout>

### Managing Forked Conversations

**Naming Conventions:**
- Forked conversations are automatically named "Fork of [Original Name]"
- Rename forked conversations with descriptive titles to track different approaches
- Consider including the main question or alternative approach in the name

**Organization Tips:**
- Group related forks by using similar naming conventions
- Archive completed experiment branches when no longer needed
- Use the chat management options to maintain a clean workspace

<Callout type="tip">
  When experimenting with multiple approaches, consider naming your forks with descriptive suffixes like "Fork - Technical Approach" or "Fork - Alternative Solution".
</Callout>

### Best Practices for Forking

**When to Fork:**
- The conversation has veered off-topic and you want to explore a tangent
- You want to try a different approach without losing the original conversation
- You need to share a specific portion of a conversation with someone else
- You're experimenting with different prompting strategies
- You want to continue a conversation but with a different model selection

**How to Choose the Right Scope:**
- For simple continuations: "Visible Messages Only"
- For related context: "Include Related Branches"
- For maximum context: "Include All to/from Here"

**Organizing Forks:**
- Rename forks immediately to reflect their purpose
- Delete or archive experimental forks that didn't yield useful results
- Keep your workspace organized by managing fork proliferation

### Summary

Ranger's forking feature provides a powerful way to manage complex conversations and explore multiple directions:

- Create branches to explore side topics without derailing the main conversation
- Choose from multiple scope options to control how much context is carried forward
- Maintain organization across related but separate conversation threads
- Experiment with different approaches while preserving valuable context
- Share specific portions of conversations without exposing the entire history

By using forking effectively, you can maintain a more organized and productive workflow when working with complex topics or multiple approaches.
