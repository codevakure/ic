### Using Search Effectively

**Basic Searches:**
1. Click on the search bar in the left navigation panel
2. Type keywords related to your search
3. Review the results that appear instantly
4. Click on any result to navigate directly to that conversation

**Advanced Search Techniques:**

- **Multiple Keywords:** Include several terms to narrow results (e.g., "quarterly report finance")
- **Specific Phrases:** Use quotation marks for exact matches (e.g., "customer onboarding process")
- **Context Words:** Add contextual terms to find more relevant results

<Callout type="tip">
  When searching for specific information, include distinctive words that are likely to appear only in relevant conversations rather than common terms that might appear in many chats.
