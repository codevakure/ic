## Critical Data Operations

### Clear All Chats
**Clear All Chats**: Permanently delete all conversation history

<Callout type="warning">
  Clearing all chats is an irreversible action. Make sure to export any important conversations before using this feature.
</Callout>

**When to use**: For privacy or to free up space, with extreme caution as this action cannot be undone.

**Before clearing all chats**:
1. **Export important conversations** to preserve valuable content
2. **Review recent work** to ensure nothing critical will be lost
3. **Check shared links** as they will become invalid
4. **Backup any referenced files** or data from conversations
5. **Confirm this is necessary** as recovery is impossible

## Data Security Best Practices

### Regular Backups
- **Weekly exports**: Create regular conversation backups
- **Selective archiving**: Export and archive completed projects
- **Multiple formats**: Use different export formats for different purposes
- **Secure storage**: Store backups in secure, encrypted locations

### Access Control
- **Review shared links**: Regularly audit who has access to your conversations
- **Revoke unused access**: Remove access for completed projects or former collaborators
- **Monitor activity**: Check for unusual access patterns
- **Update permissions**: Adjust sharing settings as team dynamics change

### Privacy Management
- **Sensitive data handling**: Use temporary chats for confidential information
- **Regular cleanup**: Clear unnecessary cached data and temporary files
- **Access review**: Periodically revoke and refresh credentials
- **Data minimization**: Only share what's necessary for collaboration

## Import/Export Strategies

### Migration Planning
- **Inventory current data**: Catalog existing conversations and their importance
- **Format compatibility**: Ensure export formats match destination platform requirements
- **Data validation**: Verify imported conversations maintain integrity and formatting
- **Gradual migration**: Move data in stages to avoid overwhelming the system

### Backup Workflows
- **Automated exports**: Set up regular export schedules for active projects
- **Project-based backups**: Export conversations by project or time period
- **Version control**: Maintain multiple backup versions for important work
- **Recovery testing**: Periodically test import procedures with backup data

### Collaboration Management
- **Team coordination**: Establish shared backup and export procedures
- **Access documentation**: Maintain records of who has access to what data
- **Transition planning**: Prepare for team member changes or project handoffs
- **Compliance alignment**: Ensure data handling meets organizational requirements

## Advanced Data Controls

- **Reporting**: Generate summaries and reports from conversation exports
- **Trend identification**: Track topics and themes across time periods

### Integration Workflows
- **API connectivity**: Use exported data with other tools and platforms
