## How Memory Works

### Information Storage
Ranger's memory system stores:
- **Preferences**: Your preferred communication style, formats, and approaches
- **Context**: Industry, role, and project information you've shared
- **Patterns**: Common tasks, workflows, and recurring themes
- **Feedback**: Responses you've liked, edited, or found helpful

### Privacy and Control
- **Selective Memory**: You control what information is remembered
- **Memory Management**: Review and edit stored memories
- **Data Ownership**: Your memory data belongs to you
- **Conversation Isolation**: Memories don't interfere with specific conversation contexts

## Memory Benefits

- **Reduced Repetition**: No need to re-explain your role, industry, or preferences
- **Consistent Style**: Responses match your preferred tone and format
- **Context Awareness**: Ranger understands your ongoing projects and goals

## Managing Memory Settings

### Enabling Memory
When you enable Memory, Ranger will:
