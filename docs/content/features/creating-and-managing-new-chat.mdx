### Chat Organization

Chats in the threads panel are arranged chronologically to ensure easy access to both current and past conversations:

**Organization Structure:**
- **Most recent chats:** Displayed at the top of the list
- **Older chats:** Grouped by time periods, such as:
  - Yesterday
  - Previous 7 days
  - Earlier conversations

This chronological structure helps you quickly find recent conversations while keeping older chats accessible when needed.

<Callout type="tip">
  Use the search functionality to quickly locate specific chats by keyword or topic.

#### Available Chat Options

| Option | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Rename** | Update the chat's title for easier identification | To organize chats by project, client, or topic (e.g., "Q4 Budget Analysis") |
| **Duplicate** | Generate a copy of the chat | When using a conversation as a template for similar tasks |
| **Delete** | Permanently remove the chat | When the conversation is no longer needed or contains outdated information |

<Callout type="warning">
  The Delete action is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure you no longer need the conversation before deleting it.
</Callout>

### Chat Management Best Practices

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use descriptive names that include project or client information

- Examples: "Client Onboarding - Smith Corp", "Monthly Report - Sept 2024"

- Use descriptive names with the rename feature to keep chats organized
- Use duplication for recurring task templates
- Regularly delete outdated conversations to maintain a clean workspace

**Maintenance:**
- Regularly review and organize your chat list using the rename feature
