## Chat Commands

Ranger offers powerful keyboard commands that allow for quick access to essential features without interrupting your workflow. These commands enhance productivity by providing shortcuts to frequently used functions.

### Overview

Chat commands in Ranger are special keyboard triggers that activate specific functionality directly from the chat input field:

- Toggle commands that provide quick access to models, prompts, and response settings
- Intuitive shortcuts for accessing advanced features without navigating menus
- Seamless integration with your typing experience

<Callout type="tip">
  Commands are designed to speed up your workflow by reducing the need to navigate through menus for common actions.
</Callout>

### Available Commands

#### The "@" Command

**Purpose**: Switch between endpoints, models, and presets

**How to Use**:
1. Type "@" at the beginning of your message or wherever you want to switch models
2. A dropdown menu appears with available models and endpoints
3. Select the desired model or endpoint
4. Continue typing your message with the selected model

**When to Use**:
- When you need to switch between different AI models for specific tasks
- When working with specialized models for particular domains (code, creative writing, etc.)
- When you want to test the same prompt across multiple models
- For tasks requiring specific capabilities only available in certain models

<Callout type="info">
  The "@" command is particularly useful when you're working on complex tasks that benefit from different AI models' strengths, allowing you to switch models without starting a new conversation.
</Callout>

**Example Use Case**:
```
@GPT-4 Can you help me optimize this database query?
```

#### The "+" Command

**Purpose**: Configure multi-response settings

**How to Use**:
1. Type "+" at the beginning of your message
2. A configuration panel appears for setting multi-response parameters
3. Select the desired number of responses or variation settings
4. Continue with your prompt to receive multiple responses

**When to Use**:
- When brainstorming and you want multiple different ideas
- When you need alternative approaches to a problem
- When comparing different possible answers to evaluate options
- For creative tasks where variety is valuable

<Callout type="tip">
  Use the "+" command when you need diverse perspectives or want to compare different approaches to the same question. This is especially valuable for creative tasks or when exploring solutions to complex problems.
</Callout>

**Example Use Case**:
```
+ Give me three different approaches to improve fraud detection in a banking system
```

#### The "/" Command

**Purpose**: Access and select prompts via keyboard

**How to Use**:
1. Type "/" at the beginning of your message
2. A searchable list of saved prompts appears
3. Navigate through available prompts using arrow keys or by typing to search
4. Select a prompt to use as a template for your current message

**When to Use**:
- When using frequently repeated prompt structures
- For consistent formatting across similar requests
- To access saved prompt templates without breaking your flow
- When working with complex prompts that you've previously optimized

<Callout type="info">
  The "/" command helps maintain consistency in your prompts and saves time by letting you reuse well-crafted prompts you've saved for recurring tasks.
</Callout>

**Example Use Case**:
```
/code-review Please review the following JavaScript function...
```

### Combining Commands

Ranger's commands can be combined for even more powerful interactions:

**How to Use Combined Commands**:
1. Start with the command that sets the context (like "/" for a prompt)
2. Add additional commands as needed (like "@" to specify a model)
3. Complete your message with your specific request

**When to Use Combined Commands**:
- For complex workflows requiring multiple parameters
- When you need both specific models and multiple responses
- To apply saved prompts with specific model settings

<Callout type="tip">
  Combining commands allows for sophisticated interactions. For example, you could use "/risk-assessment @GPT-4 + Show me three different approaches to evaluate loan approval criteria for high-value transactions."
</Callout>

### Best Practices

**Efficiency Tips**:
- Memorize the commands you use most frequently
- Create saved prompts for recurring tasks to use with the "/" command
- Use "@" to quickly switch models when one isn't performing well for your task
- Leverage "+" for creative tasks where multiple perspectives are valuable

**Workflow Integration**:
- Start by using one command at a time until you're comfortable
- Gradually incorporate combined commands for more complex workflows
- Create custom prompts optimized for specific models to use with the "@" and "/" commands together

<Callout type="info">
  Commands become more powerful as you integrate them into your natural workflow. With practice, they'll become second nature and significantly speed up your interactions.
</Callout>

### Customization

You can enable or disable individual commands in your settings:

1. Access Settings from your account option at the bottom of the left side panel
2. Navigate to the "Commands" section
3. Toggle individual commands on/off based on your preferences
4. Save your settings

<Callout type="tip">
  If you find yourself not using certain commands, you can disable them in settings to prevent accidentally triggering them during normal typing.
</Callout>

### Use Cases by Profession

**Software Developers**:
- Use "@" to switch between code-optimized models for different languages
- Use "/" to access saved code review or refactoring prompts
- Use "+" to generate multiple solution approaches for algorithms

**Content Creators**:
- Use "@" to switch between models optimized for different content styles
- Use "/" to access saved content templates
- Use "+" to generate multiple headline or introduction variations

**Researchers**:
- Use "@" to access more advanced models for complex analyses
- Use "/" to maintain consistent query structures for literature reviews
- Use "+" to explore multiple interpretations of research findings

<Callout type="tip">
  Tailor your command usage to your profession's specific needs. Over time, you'll develop command patterns that significantly enhance your productivity.
</Callout>

### Troubleshooting

**If Commands Aren't Working**:
- Check if the command is enabled in your settings
- Ensure you're typing the command at the start of your message or after a space
- Try refreshing the application if commands stop responding

<Callout type="info">
  If a command isn't working as expected, check your settings to ensure it's enabled and properly configured.
</Callout>
