### Document Management

Managing your uploaded files is simple through the account section:

- All uploaded files for any option are visible in **Account → My Files** in the left panel
- Users can delete uploaded files from My Files
- Files cannot be downloaded
- Files uploaded in one chat thread cannot be accessed in other threads
- Users can continue to chat through documents uploaded within that thread

<Callout type="warning">
  Remember that documents are thread-specific - if you need to reference a document in multiple conversations, you'll need to upload it in each thread separately.
</Callout>

### Best Practices for Attaching Files

**For Image Uploads:**
- Ensure images are clear and have good resolution
- Crop unnecessary parts before uploading
- Use descriptive questions when asking about image content

**For Document Uploads:**
- Use specific questions referencing content you expect to find
- Utilize natural language queries instead of keywords
- Reference specific sections or page numbers when possible
- Upload related documents together for comparative analysis

### Summary

Ranger's file attachment features provide flexible options for incorporating various file types into your conversations:

- **Upload Image:** Share visual content directly in the chat

By utilizing these file attachment options effectively, you can enhance your interactions with Ranger through rich content sharing and document analysis capabilities.
