<Callout type="warning">
  Unlike other tools, Web Search requires manual selection from the Tools panel. It will not activate automatically based on your prompt.

## How Web Search Works

- When you provide a query, Ranger decides whether to perform a web search based on the prompt
- The tool executes the search and retrieves relevant web results
- This process may occur multiple times within a single request if Ranger determines additional information is needed
- At the end of its response, Ranger provides a final answer with sources and citations

## Citations

Each search result returned by Web Search includes:
- **url:** The URL of the cited source
- **title:** The title of the cited source

  Web Search is especially useful for queries about current events, recent developments, or information that may have changed since Ranger's training data cutoff.
