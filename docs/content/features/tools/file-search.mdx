# File Search (RAG-enabled)

The File Search tool is automatically activated when you upload documents or ask questions that require document analysis. It leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide context-aware responses based on uploaded files.

## How it Works

- When you upload files, Ranger automatically activates File Search and indexes the content, creating embeddings
- Ranger performs semantic search over the uploaded files to find the most relevant information based on your queries
- Responses in the chat are augmented with the retrieved information, ensuring accurate, context-aware answers
- The process is thread-specific, meaning the uploaded files and search results are available only in the current chat thread

## Steps to Use

1. Click the attachment icon in the message box. You'll see two upload options: **Upload Image** and **Upload Document**
2. Select **Upload Documents** to activate File Search and RAG processing automatically
3. Choose the files to upload from your device
4. Ask questions, and Ranger will search your uploaded files to provide context-aware answers

For more detailed information about uploading files and attachment options, see our [Attachments guide](/features/attach-files).

## Key Features of RAG in File Search

- **Document Indexing:** Creates embeddings of uploaded files for fast retrieval
- **Semantic Search:** Finds the most relevant information based on user input
- **Context-Aware Responses:** Augments queries with retrieved data for accurate answers
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Optimized for speed and scalability
- **Flexible Configuration:** Allows customization of chunk size, overlap, and embedding model

## Benefits

- Access up-to-date and reliable information from uploaded files
- Transparency and trust: Verify sources in responses
- Reduced hallucinations: Responses are grounded in your uploaded documents
- Lower computational costs: No need to retrain the model continuously

<Callout type="tip">
  The File Search tool is particularly useful for large documents or when you need to reference specific information from multiple files at once.

![Example File Attachment](/images/exfileattach.png)

**Example:** After attaching a file, you can query the uploaded document by asking questions like "Summarize this document", "What are the key findings in this report?", or "Extract the financial data from this spreadsheet". Ranger will search through your uploaded files and provide context-aware answers based on the content.
