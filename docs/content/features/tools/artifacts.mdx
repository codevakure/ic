# Artifacts

The Artifacts tool is automatically activated when you request to generate React components, HTML code, or Mermaid diagrams. Simply describe what you want to create, and Ranger will activate this tool automatically.

<Callout type="info">
  Artifacts activates automatically when you request UI components, code snippets, or diagrams. No manual tool selection is needed.
</Callout>

## Key Features

- **Generative UI:** Instant prototyping of websites and UIs
- **Flexible Integration:** Works with any model configured in Ranger
- **Iterative Design:** Quickly refine generated outputs
- **Complex Idea Visualization:** Create Mermaid diagrams
- **Interactive Learning:** Experiment with React and HTML
- **Artifacts Options:** Access component libraries and templates
- **Shadcn/ui Components:** Use shadcn/ui design system components
- **Custom Prompt Mode:** Craft and reuse tailored prompts for specific workflows or departments. Once activated, it appears in the chat interface

## Example Use Cases

- Create reusable templates for client onboarding emails or standardized reporting formats
- Generate prototype UI components for web applications
- Visualize workflows and processes using Mermaid diagrams
- Build HTML snippets for email templates or simple web pages

## When to Use

- Building interfaces requiring consistent design elements
- Implementing standard UI patterns
- Performing repetitive tasks requiring similar prompts across a team
- Visualizing complex relationships or processes

<Callout type="tip">
  Use the Artifacts tool when you need to quickly prototype visual elements or create structured diagrams that would be difficult to describe in text alone.

## Artifacts Interface Controls

When an artifact is generated, you'll see several interface controls in the top-right and bottom sections of the artifact panel:

**Top-Right Controls:**
- **Eye Symbol (👁)**: Click to view the artifact in preview mode

  - When clicked, reveals two additional options:
    - **Full Screen**: Expands the artifact to full screen for better viewing
    - **Reload**: Refreshes the artifact content

**Example:**

- **Code Symbol (`<>`)**: Click to view the HTML source code of the artifact
- **X Symbol**: Closes the side panel containing the artifact

**Bottom Controls:**
- **Copy**: Copies the artifact code to your clipboard for external use
- **Download**: Downloads the artifact as a file to your local machine

These controls provide comprehensive options for viewing, inspecting, and exporting your generated artifacts, making it easy to integrate them into your projects or share them with others.

## Examples

Here are some examples of what you can create with Artifacts:

**React Components:** Create interactive UI components, login forms, dashboards, and web applications.
