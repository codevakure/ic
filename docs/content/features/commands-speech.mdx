# Commands & Speech

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts can dramatically improve your efficiency when working with Ranger, especially during intensive work sessions requiring frequent model or prompt switching.

### Model Switching Shortcut

**Toggle "@" for switching endpoints/models**: Enable quick model switching with the @ symbol.

- **Enable**: Type "@" to quickly switch between different AI models
- **Disable**: Use standard interface methods for model selection

**When to use**: Enable for quick model switching during technical tasks that require different AI capabilities.

**How it works**:
- Type "@" in the message box
- Select from available models/endpoints
- Continue typing your message with the new model

### Prompt Selection

**Toggle "/" for prompt selection via keyboard**: Quick access to prompt templates and saved queries.

- **Enable**: Type "/" to access prompt library via keyboard
- **Disable**: Use interface buttons for prompt selection

**When to use**: Enable for quick access to prompt templates and saved queries.

**How it works**:
- Type "/" in the message box
- Browse available prompts and templates
- Select and customize prompts without leaving the keyboard

### Document Selection

**Toggle "#" for document selection via keyboard**: Quick access to previously uploaded documents.

- **Enable**: Type "#" to access your uploaded documents library via keyboard
- **Disable**: Use interface buttons for document selection

**When to use**: Enable for quick access to reference previously uploaded files without re-uploading.

**How it works**:
- Type "#" in the message box
- Browse your available uploaded documents
- Select documents to reference in your conversation

## Speech

### Microphone (Voice Input)

You can use your microphone to give voice prompts directly to Ranger. Click the microphone icon in the chat input to start recording your prompt.

**How to use:**
- Click the microphone icon in the chat input
- Allow browser microphone permissions when prompted
- Speak your prompt clearly; Ranger will transcribe and process it as if you typed it

**Notes:**
- Microphone access requires browser permission. If you deny permissions, the voice input won't work until you re-enable them in your browser settings.
- Keep background noise to a minimum for best transcription accuracy.

### Playback (Speaker)

After Ranger generates a reply, you can listen to the response by clicking the speaker icon located at the end of the chat response. This plays back the assistant's text as audio.

**How to use playback:**
- Look for the speaker icon at the end of any assistant response
- Click the icon to start audio playback of the response
- Use your system volume controls to adjust playback loudness

**Notes:**
- Playback uses your browser's audio output device. Ensure your speakers or headphones are connected and not muted.
- If audio doesn't play, check browser permissions for audio output and any system-level audio settings.

## Command Workflow Benefits

### Efficiency Gains

- **Reduced Mouse Usage**: Keep hands on keyboard for faster interaction
- **Quick Context Switching**: Rapidly change models based on task requirements
- **Template Access**: Instantly access frequently used prompts and formats

### Professional Workflow

- **Consistent Formatting**: Use templates for standardized outputs
- **Multi-Model Comparison**: Quickly compare responses from different AI models
- **Streamlined Process**: Reduce clicks and interface navigation

## Command Usage Examples

### Model Switching with "@"

```
@thinking-model What's the best approach to solve this algorithm?
@instant-model Quick summary of this document
@research-model Detailed analysis of market trends
```

### Prompt Selection with "/"

```
/email-template Draft a professional follow-up email
/report-format Create a quarterly business report
/code-review Analyze this code for improvements
```

### Document Selection with "#"

```
#quarterly-report What are the key metrics from this report?
#meeting-notes Summarize the action items from this document
#research-paper Explain the methodology used in this study
```
